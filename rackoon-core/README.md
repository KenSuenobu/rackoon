# rackoon-core

This is the core library that creates the service accessors,
routes, model classes, and DAOs for general use in the main server
code.

## Running the server

Use the following commands:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

You can also run the test suite by running:

```bash
yarn test
```

This will point to the local Postgres instance.
